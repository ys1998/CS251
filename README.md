## Software Systems Lab : Assignments' collection
### Using your branch
Create a local repository by using this command:
```
git clone <url to remote repo's branch>
```
Create a directory named `outlab-XX` in the local repo and write your code in it preserving the directory structure provided to us by the TA's.

Work on your local repo and upload your part of the assignment in your remote repo branch as and when you complete it.

To push your code from your local repository to the remote (online) repo, execute this push command after adding and commiting the files:
```
git push origin <branch-name>
```
Here the branch-names are `saurav`, `saunack` and `yash`.

After all have submitted their part, the branches will be merged with the `master` branch. Submission will follow.
