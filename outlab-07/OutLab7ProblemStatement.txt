1. Create a file readme.txt in lab#_rollno.1_rollno.2_rollno.3_rollno.4 directory, which contains contribution of each team member and references (cite where you get code/code snippets from).
e.g.lab3_154054002_154054005_154054001


2. Rename the directory lab#_rollno.1_rollno.2_rollno.3_rollno.4 to actual lab number instead of #, replace the rollno.N with your respective roll numbers.
e.g.lab3_154054002_154054005_154054001

4. Submit one assignment per team.  



Q1)	Please find the repo on https://git.cse.iitb.ac.in/ananya/ganit. All instructions are in the README. Do not fork this repo, just clone it to your machine, work on the problem and submit a folder called ganit. Clarification requests if any should be made by opening an issue.

Q2)	In the inlab doxygen question, you created an HTML documentation for 2 'cpp' files.
In this question, you will have to produce documentation of a java program and a python program. You must go through both the programs and execute them (if necessary). Comment all the relevant portions (similar to the inlab question) and produce the documentation.

For both the programs, documentation should be in 'pdf' format. (NOT IN HTML)

For executing the python code, you will have to install python 3.2 or newer in your system and use the following command: 
python3 python_problem.py	
(Do not delete the file named 'data', which has been provided. It is an input file for the python program 'python_problem.py')

Note
For Q1, if you have problems in accessing the repository, please send an email to ananya@cse.iitb.ac.in
