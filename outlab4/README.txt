*******************COMMENTS**********************
1. the normal commit message states something like n files changed, n insertion(+), n deletion(-). But this line is removed after resolving merge conflict because now the conflicted file matches the latest file on the server so there is no need to remove or add anything. However, when there is no conflict, the file must change and a new file is inserted alongwith the commits and at the same time the old file is deleted.
